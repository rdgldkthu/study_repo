# OpenCV Tutorials

> Study notes and example codes from the official OpenCV tutorials

## Goals

- Understand core modules of OpenCV (core, imgproc, highgui, calib3d, etc.)
- Implement basic image/video processing tasks using C++.
- Explore advanced topics: feature detection, object detection, DNN, 3D reconstruction.

## Setup

- Development environment: Visual Studio Code
- OpenCV version: 4.12.0
- Compiler: GCC
- OS: Windows, Linux

## Notes / References

- GitHub repo: [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
- Documentation: [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/)
  - Official tutorial: [OpenCV Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html)

## Future

- Build multi-stage projects combining image processing + object detection.
- Integrate OpenCV with ROS2 or SLAM pipelines for robotics applications.
- Explore GPU-accelerated features and OpenCV DNN for real-time vision tasks.
